# Intro Android Jetpack
We, [Tobias Fischer](https://github.com/tformatix) and [Michael Zauner](https://github.com/Maikaru-Sensei), had to prepare a paper, a presentation (in german) and a workshop on any topic for the subject "Scientific Work" in the bachelor program Mobile Computing at FH Hagenberg. We chose the topic Android Jetpack, because this library suite becomes more and more important for Android developers. 

## Abstract Paper
Android has a huge library landscape, although it is difficult to choose the right one. Jetpack is a collection of libraries designed to make app development easier and decrease boilerplate code. Jetpack libraries use contemporary design approaches to reduce crashes and memory leaks. This paper gives a short insight into Android Jetpack, its major libraries and its benefits and drawbacks.

## Workshop Jetpack Compose
The goal of this workshop was to introduce Jetpack Compose to fellow students. The sample app should contain the simplest blog functionalities, where colleagues can chat together.

### Backend
The backend was built with ASP.NET Core 6 Web API. For the purposes of our workshop, it was hosted on Azure. The source files for the Android project were created with [openapi-generator-cli](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator-cli).

### Android
There are two Android projects:
* Template: includes some TODOs, which were worked through together
* Solution
